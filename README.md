## Overview of project

Pancreas cancer is the king of cancer, the survival rate drops hard when time passes. Thus, diagnosing panaceas cancer in the early stage is significant. To test the two risk factors of pancreas cancer, alcohol, and smoking. I will identify the influence among alcohol user + smoker, alcohol user + non-smoker, non-alcohol + smoker, and non-alcohol + non-smoker in pancreas cancer. This analysis will utilize [GDC](https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/repository?facetTab=cases&filters=%7B%22op%22%3A%22and%22%2C%22content%22%3A%5B%7B%22op%22%3A%22in%22%2C%22content%22%3A%7B%22field%22%3A%22cases.primary_site%22%2C%22value%22%3A%5B%22pancreas%22%5D%7D%7D%2C%7B%22op%22%3A%22in%22%2C%22content%22%3A%7B%22field%22%3A%22cases.project.program.name%22%2C%22value%22%3A%5B%22TCGA%22%5D%7D%7D%2C%7B%22op%22%3A%22in%22%2C%22content%22%3A%7B%22field%22%3A%22files.analysis.workflow_type%22%2C%22value%22%3A%5B%22HTSeq%20-%20Counts%22%5D%7D%7D%5D%7D&searchTableTab=cases) For this analysis, I’ll utilize the TCGA cohort, and have identified 177 cases for pancreas cancer that fit within my cohort.

## Data

I will use the data from [GDC](https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/repository). Examining clinical data, there are 117 cases with 101 has alcohol history, and 57 smoking history. 


## Milestone 1

Complete data loaded with alcohol history and smoking history cases, prepare to crossmatch and compare. 

**Due Date:** Thursday November 11th

** Data fully loaded into vignette through HT-SEQ steps ** I will complete an entire first draft of analysis analyzed through the vignette.


## Milestone 2

Crossmatch and compare the influence among 4 groups of cases. Prepare for deliver. 

**An initial completion of vignette.** I will complete an entire first draft of analysis analyzed through the vignette.Data loaded into vignette (through htseq), for seeking feedback.  Not all sections in the writing will be completed, but will be final project.


## Deliverable

**Due Date:** December 3rd

A complete repository with clear documentation and description of your analysis and results.
